## Abstract

One of the key ideas to make intelligent transportation
systems work effectively is to deploy advanced communication
and cooperative control technologies among vehicles and
road infrastructures. In this spirit, we propose a consensus-based
distributed speed advisory system that optimally determines a
recommended common speed for a given area in order that the
group emissions, or group battery consumptions, are minimized.
Our algorithms achieve this in a privacy-aware manner; that is,
individual vehicles do not reveal in-vehicle information to other
vehicles or to infrastructure. A mobility simulator is used to illustrate
the efficacy of the algorithm, and hardware-in-the-loop tests
involving a real vehicle are given to illustrate user acceptability
and ease of deployment.
