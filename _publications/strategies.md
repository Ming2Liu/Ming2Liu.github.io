## Abstract

In recent years, a wide variety of centralised
and decentralised algorithms have been proposed for
residential charging of electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper,
we present a mathematical framework which casts the
EV charging scenarios addressed by these algorithms as
optimisation problems having either temporal or instantaneous
optimisation objectives with respect to the different
actors in the power system. Using this framework and a
realistic distribution network simulation testbed, we provide
a comparative evaluation of a range of different
residential EV charging strategies, highlighting in each
case positive and negative characteristics.
