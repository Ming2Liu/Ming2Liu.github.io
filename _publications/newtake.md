## Abstract

Pollution in urban centers is becoming a major societal problem. While pollution is a concern for all urban
dwellers, cyclists are one of the most exposed groups due to their proximity to vehicle tailpipes. Consequently, new solutions
are required to help protect citizens, especially cyclists, from the harmful effects of exhaust-gas emissions. In this context,
hybrid vehicles (HVs) offer new actuation possibilities that can be exploited in this direction. More specifically, such vehicles, when
working together as a group, have the ability to dynamically lower the emissions in a given area, thus benefiting citizens,
whilst still giving the vehicle owner the flexibility of using an internal combustion engine. This paper aims to develop
an algorithm that can be deployed in such vehicles, whereby geofences (virtual geographic boundaries) are used to specify
areas of low pollution around cyclists. The emissions level inside the geofence is controlled via a coin-tossing algorithm to switch
the HV motor into, and out of, electric mode, in a manner that is in some sense optimal. The optimality criterion is based on
how polluting vehicles inside the geofence are, and the expected density of cyclists near each vehicle. The algorithm is triggered
once a vehicle detects a cyclist. Implementations are presented both in simulation and in a real vehicle, and the system is tested
using a hardware-in-the-loop platform (video provided).
