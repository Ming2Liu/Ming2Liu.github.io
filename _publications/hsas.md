## Abstract

In this paper, an application based on the Intelligent
Speed Adaptation (ISA) system is proposed to reduce CO2
emissions of vehicles running on the highway. We apply the
idea of optimised consensus to solve the emission optimisation
problem in a simplified highway scenario through simulation
study. Our approach shows that total CO2 emissions of vehicles
can be minimised if all vehicles follow the reference speed signal
derived from the ISA.
