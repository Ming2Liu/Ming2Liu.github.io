## Abstract

Traffic flow pattern identification, as well as anomaly detection, is known to be an important component for
traffic operations and control. Alongside classical applications, mainly, to improve the safety and the comfort of drivers, more
recently there is a growing interest in gathering personalised route information to provide customised services. With this
latter application in mind, in this paper we investigate the ability of simple macroscopic information (i.e., time varying
junction turning probabilities) to identify changes in nominal urban traffic flows, most likely due to the occurrence of
external events (e.g., road works or traffic congestions). Some preliminary results obtained with the use of a realistic mobility
simulator are also illustrated and discussed, and some candidate applications are briefly outlined.
