## Abstract

We discuss a recently introduced ECO-driving concept known as smart procurement of naturally generated energy (SPONGE)
in the context of plug-in hybrid electric buses. Examples are given to illustrate the benefits of this approach to ECO-driving. 
Finally, distributed algorithms to realize SPONGE are discussed, paying attention to the privacy implications of the underlying optimization problems.
