## Abstract

We present here a general framework and a specific algorithm for predicting the destination, route, or more generally a pattern, 
of an ongoing journey, building on the recent work of. In the presented framework, known journey patterns are modelled as stochastic processes, 
emitting the road segments visited during the journey, and the ongoing journey is predicted by updating the posterior probability of each journey pattern given the road segments visited so far. 
In this contribution, we use Markov chains as models for the journey patterns, and consider the prediction as final, once one of the posterior probabilities crosses a predefined threshold. 
Despite the simplicity of both, examples run on a synthetic dataset demonstrate high accuracy of the made predictions.
