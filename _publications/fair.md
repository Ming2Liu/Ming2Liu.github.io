## Abstract

The development of smart grid technologies and appropriate charging strategies are key to accommodating large numbers of Electric Vehicles (EV) charging on the grid.
In this paper a general framework is presented for formulating the EV charging optimization problem and three different charging strategies are investigated 
and compared from the perspective of charging fairness while taking into account power system constraints. 
Two strategies are based on distributed algorithms, namely, Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD), 
and Distributed Price-Feedback (DPF), while the third is an ideal centralized solution used to benchmark performance. 
he algorithms are evaluated using a simulation of a typical residential low voltage distribution network with 50% EV penetration.
