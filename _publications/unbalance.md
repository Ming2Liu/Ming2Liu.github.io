## Abstract

Electric Vehicle (EV) technology has developed rapidly in recent years, with the
result that increasing levels of EV penetration are expected on electrical grids in the near
future. The increasing electricity demand due to EVs is expected to provide many challenges
for grid companies, and it is expected that it will be necessary to reinforce the current electrical
grid infrastructure to cater for increasing loads at distribution level. However, by harnessing
the power of Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technologies, groups of EVs could be harnessed to provide
ancillary services to the grid. Current unbalance occurs at distribution level when currents
are unbalanced between each of the phases. In this paper a distributed consensus algorithm
is used to coordinate EV charging in order to minimise current unbalance. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in rebalancing phase currents.
