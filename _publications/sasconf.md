## Abstract

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can be
used to involve vehicles and the road infrastructure to cooperatively
implement a number of innovative and useful applications.
Here, we explore the possibility to adopt a consensus based
distributed speed advisory system to determine the optimal
recommended speed in urban areas where only electric vehicles
are allowed to travel (e.g., in the city centre). The optimality
criterion is to maximise the energy efficiency of a fleet of vehicles
travelling in the restricted area, and we adopt recently proposed
distributed privacy-preserving consensus algorithms to achieve
the desired objective.
