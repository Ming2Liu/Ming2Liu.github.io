## Abstract

Car sharing is a successful commercial application
based on the collaborative consumption model. In this paper, we
apply a recently proposed idea from a car sharing scheme to solve
a fleet dimension problem emerging in utilities with large vehicle
fleets. Within this framework, EVs are used to replace Internal
Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) to reduce fleet pollutants.
A small number of additional ICE vehicles are purchased to
service long trips. The number of such vehicles are determined
using a queueing model. Our studies show that pollutants can
be significantly reduced while still providing a good quality of
service (QoS) for staff to access vehicles.
