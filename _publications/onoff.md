## Abstract

The development of appropriate Electric Vehicle (EV)
charging strategies has been identified as an effective way to
accommodate an increasing number of EVs on Low Voltage (LV)
distribution networks. Most research studies to date assume that
future charging facilities will be capable of regulating charge
rates continuously, while very few papers consider the more
realistic situation of EV chargers that support only on-off
charging functionality. In this work, a distributed charging
algorithm applicable to on-off based charging systems is
presented. Then, a modified version of the algorithm is proposed
to incorporate real power system constraints. Both algorithms
are compared with uncontrolled and centralized charging
strategies from the perspective of both utilities and customers.
