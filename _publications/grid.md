## Abstract

This paper introduces distributed algorithms that
share the power generation task in an optimized fashion among
the several Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) within a
microgrid. We borrow certain concepts from communication network
theory, namely Additive-Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease
(AIMD) algorithms, which are known to be convenient in terms
of communication requirements and network efficiency.We adapt
the synchronized version of AIMD to minimize a cost utility
function of interest in the framework of smart grids. We then
implement the AIMD utility optimisation strategies in a realistic
power network simulation in Matlab-OpenDSS environment, and
we show that the performance is very close to the full-communication
centralized case.
