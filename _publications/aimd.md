## Abstract

In this paper we consider charging strategies that mitigate
the impact of domestic charging of EVs on low-voltage distribution networks
and which seek to reduce peak power by responding to time-ofday
pricing. The strategies are based on the distributed Additive Increase
and Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) charging algorithms proposed in [5].
The strategies are evaluated using simulations conducted on a custom
OpenDSS-Matlab platform for a typical low voltage residential feeder
network. Results show that by using AIMD based smart charging 50%
EV penetration can be accommodated on our test network, compared
to only 10% with uncontrolled charging, without needing to reinforce
existing network infrastructure.
