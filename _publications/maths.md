## Abstract

We consider a class of consensus systems driven by a nonlinear input. 
Such systems arise in a class ofInternet ofThings(IOT) applications. Our objective in this paper 
is to determine conditions under which a certain partially distributed system converges to a Lur{'}e-like 
scalar system, and to provide a rigorous proof of its stability.
Conditions are derived for the non-uniform convergence and stability of such a system and an example
is given of a speed advisory system where such a system arises.
