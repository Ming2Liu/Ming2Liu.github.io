## Abstract

This paper proposes a congestion balancing parking guidance system that suggests to a driver a sequence of streets to
follow around the desired destination with the aim to reduce the total distance that is travelled while searching for a free parking
spot. The system requires only limited infrastructure information, and neither requires parking spaces to be instrumented, nor
vehicles to communicate with each other. Specifically, the system utilizes parking vacancy information on each street. The system
also accounts for the added cost of not finding a free space, which is typically expressed as the additional distance that needs to be
travelled to find an available parking spot. To avoid local congestion, different drivers respond to different suggestions based
on a probability distribution that considers the total distance that needs to be travelled. A mobility simulator is used to model
the searching behaviors of vehicles for parking spaces with and without the smart parking algorithm and experimental results are
provided using the road network of the city of Dublin, Ireland.
