## Abstract

This paper illustrates stochastic distributed algorithms
that optimally share the electrical and thermal power
generation task among the several Distributed Energy Resources
(DERs) within a microgrid. We borrow certain concepts
from communication network theory, namely Additive-Increase-
Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) algorithms, which are known
to be convenient in terms of communication requirements and
network efficiency. We adapt them to minimise a cost utility
function of interest in the framework of smart grids. We then
implement the AIMD utility optimisation strategies in a realistic
power network simulation in Matlab-OpenDSS environment, and
we show the performance of the proposed algorithms in achieving
thermal and electrical power balancing
