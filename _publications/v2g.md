## Abstract

Among the many motivations to encourage the use
of Electric Vehicles (EVs) there is the attractive possibility
to implement Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) functionalities. They are
attractive both for EV owners, who can sell their own energy
to the grid when they do not need to travel, and also for
the power grid, as the stored energy can be used to back-up
the fluctuating energy produced from renewable sources or to
improve the grid stability at critical times. In this paper we
illustrate a distributed algorithm that solves the V2G problem
in a fair manner, trying to achieve an optimal trade-off between
power generation costs and inconvenience to the vehicle owner.
Results are shown and discussed for a case study simulated in
the OpenDSS power system environment.
