### 1. [Saliency Detection for Underwater Moving Object with Sonar Based on Motion Estimation and Multi-Trajectory Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320324007945)  
**Zhu, J., Cai, W., Zhang, M., Lin, Y., and Liu, M.**  
*Pattern Recognition*, 2025, 158, 111043.

Published in the top-tier journal *Pattern Recognition* (Impact Factor: 7.5, Q1), this paper proposes a saliency detection framework for tracking underwater moving objects. The approach integrates motion estimation, trajectory analysis, and a local-to-global saliency mapping model, and is validated using a custom sonar data acquisition system. Extensive experiments on eight sonar videos demonstrate superior performance over 15 state-of-the-art methods.

### 4. [MPC-CSAS: Multi-Party Computation for Real-Time Privacy-Preserving Speed Advisory Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9339974)  
**Liu, M., Cheng, L., Gu, Y., Wang, Y., Liu, Q., and O’Connor, N.E.**  
*IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, 2021, 23(6), pp. 5887–5893.

This paper, published in *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems* (Q1, Impact Factor: 7.9), presents a real-time privacy-preserving framework using multi-party computation for speed advisory systems. It demonstrates low latency and high efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale deployment without additional ICT infrastructure. The work was nominated for recognition within the ITS Society.

### 5. [A Distributed Markovian Parking Assist System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8467499)  
**Liu, M., Naoum-Sawaya, J., Gu, Y., Lecue, F., and Shorten, R.**  
*IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, 2018, 20(6), pp. 2230–2240.

This paper, published in *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems* (Q1, Impact Factor: 7.9), presents a distributed parking guidance system that leverages ant colony optimization and Markovian signaling to direct drivers to on-street parking with minimal infrastructure. By recommending routes based on parking likelihood and travel cost, the system balances congestion and improves search efficiency. Validated using SUMO simulations and real data from Dublin, it achieves significant reductions in travel time and distance.
