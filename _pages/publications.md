### 1. [Saliency Detection for Underwater Moving Object with Sonar Based on Motion Estimation and Multi-Trajectory Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320324007945)  
**Zhu, J., Cai, W., Zhang, M., Lin, Y., and Liu, M.**  
*Pattern Recognition*, 2025, 158, 111043.

Published in the top-tier journal *Pattern Recognition* (Impact Factor: 7.5, Q1), this paper proposes a saliency detection framework for tracking underwater moving objects. The approach integrates motion estimation, trajectory analysis, and a local-to-global saliency mapping model, and is validated using a custom sonar data acquisition system. Extensive experiments on eight sonar videos demonstrate superior performance over 15 state-of-the-art methods.
