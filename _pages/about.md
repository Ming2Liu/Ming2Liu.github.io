Dr. Mingming Liu is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Electronic Engineering at Dublin City University.
He received his B.Eng. degree with first class honours from the Department of Electronic Engineering 
at the National University of Ireland Maynooth in 2011, and then the PhD degree from the Hamilton Institute 
from the same university in 2015 with his thesis entitled “Topics in Electromobility and Related Applications”. 
After that, he joined University College Dublin as a postdoctoral researcher then a senior postdoctoral researcher 
with the Control Engineering and Decision Science Research Group within the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 
where he spent almost three years working on both EU and SFI funded projects, including Green Transportation and Networks (SFI) and Enable-S3 (H2020), 
with strong collaborations with both academia and industry. 

Before joining DCU, he worked at IBM Ireland lab as a data scientist, applied researcher, and H2020 project lead (5G Solutions), 
where his main focus was to leverage the state-of-the-art machine learning and applied optimisation techniques for practical and challenging problems 
arising in the industry. His current research interests include machine/deep learning, data science, centralised & distributed control and optimisation theories 
with links to electric, hybrid vehicles and IoT in the context of smart grids, intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. 
He is an IEEE member and an active reviewer in his research fields.
