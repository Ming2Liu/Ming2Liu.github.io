Dr. Mingming Liu is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Electronic Engineering at Dublin City University (DCU). 

I was a data scientist, applied researcher, and H2020 project lead (5G Solutions) at IBM Ireland Lab, where the main focus of my work was to leverage the state-of-the-art machine learning and applied optimisation techniques for practical
and challenging problems arising in the industry. Before IBM, I joined University College Dublin as a postdoctoral researcher then a senior postdoctoral researcher with the Control Engineering and Decision Science Research Group within the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 
where I spent almost three years working on both EU and SFI funded projects, including Green Transportation and Networks (SFI) and Enable-S3 (H2020), with strong collaborations with both academia and industry.
 
I received my B.Eng. degree with first class honours from the Department of Electronic Engineering at the National University of Ireland Maynooth in 2011, and then the PhD degree from the Hamilton Institute from same university in 2015 with my thesis entitled “Topics in Electromobility and Related Applications”, under the supervision of 
of Prof. Robert Shorten (Professor of Imperial College London at present) and Prof. Sean McLoone (Professor of Queen's University Belfast at present). 

I am an IEEE member and an active reviewer in my research fields. I served as a organizing committee co-chair for the 5th IEEE WF-IoT conference in Limerick. I have published several top-tier journals and conferences to date, including “IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid”, “IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System”, 
“IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering”, and “Automatica”.
