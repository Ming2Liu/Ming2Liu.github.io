Dr. Mingming Liu is currently an Assistant Professor in Electronic and Computer Engineering with the [School of Electronic Engineering](http://ece.eeng.dcu.ie/) at [Dublin City University (DCU)](https://www.dcu.ie/). 

Mingming was a data scientist, applied researcher, and H2020 project lead ([5G-Solutions](https://www.5gsolutionsproject.eu/)) at [IBM Ireland Lab](https://www.ibm.com/ie-en), where the main focus of his work was to leverage the state-of-the-art machine learning and applied optimisation techniques for practical
and challenging problems arising in the industry. Before IBM, he worked at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) as a (senior) postdoctoral research fellow with the [Control Engineering and Decision Science Research Group](http://smarttransport.ucd.ie/wordpress/) within the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. He spent almost three years working on both EU and SFI funded projects at UCD, including [Green Transportation and Networks](https://www.hamilton.ie/new-3m-research-project-in-green-transport-and-communications-networks-announced.htm) (SFI) and [Enable-S3](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/692455) (H2020), with strong collaborations with both academia and industrial partners.
 
He received his B.Eng. degree with first class honours (ranked 1st) from the [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/electronic-engineering) at the [National University of Ireland Maynooth](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/) in 2011, and then his PhD from the [Hamilton Institute](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/hamilton) at the same university in 2015 (26 years old). His PhD thesis entitled [“Topics in Electromobility and Related Applications”](http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/6522/) was supervised by [Prof. Robert Shorten](https://ROBERTshorten.com) (Full Professor at Imperial College London) and [Prof. Sean McLoone](https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/EPIC/Profile/?name=s.mcloone) (Full Professor at Queen's University Belfast). 

He is an IEEE member and an active reviewer in his research fields. He has published over 40 papers to date including top-tier journals such as [“IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5165411), [“IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6979), [“IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8856), ["IEEE System Journal"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4267003), ["IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6687316) and [“Automatica”](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/automatica). The overall impact factor of his published journal papers has been greater than 60. Since 2018, he has secured more than 900k funding support from various sources for research. In addition, he has also actively participated in many academic activities, including technical committees, organisation committees and management committees at both national and international levels. He is currently the management committee member for Ireland in the EU COST Action [CA19126](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA19126/) and [CA20138](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA20138/).
